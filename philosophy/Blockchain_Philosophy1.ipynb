        "- Blockchain : Distributed Ledger updated via Consensus, with the specific structure of Blocks (containing set of Transactions) connected one to each other in a linear way \n",

        "\n",
        "- Bitcoin : is \"just\" a currency \n",
        "  - it relies on a Blockchain to process transactions (representing currency movements) so to perform ultimately **private property tracking** (who owns what)\n",
        "  - **Observation**: \n",
        "    - current society is shaped around the idea that private property is guranteed and enforced by a central authority, so central authority is accepted \n",
        "    - Blockchain provides the infrastructure to guarantee private property in a trustless environment, with no central authority (enforcing is a different challenge, as it requires interacting in the real world)\n",
        "    - Bitcoin is an application of Blockchain to money which scaled at global level \n",
        "  - Implications: no central authority means **no human in the loop** of private property \n",
        "- Ethereum : Blockchain + Turing Complete Language \n",
        "  - Goal: **Code is Law** \n",
        "  - Implications: removing humans from private property is not enough, let's remove human from all legals stuff \n",
